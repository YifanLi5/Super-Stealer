Osbot thieving script for pickpocketing any valid NPC in the game!

## Features:

<br> 
  * Eat
  * Spam pickpocket
  * Drop Junk
  * AFK
- Dodgy Necklace support
- Shadow veil (In Progress)

## Other Notes:
- If start this script in Ardougne South Bank AND are pickpocketing Ardougne Knights. 
<br>This script will stop if your character leaves the Ardougne South Bank. 
  * Assumed to be in Ardougne knight mass pickpocket with a splasher.

## Todo List:
